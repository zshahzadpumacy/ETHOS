# ETHOS — Open wallet, clearing & POS for stablecoin payments on Ethereum

ETHOS is an open-source toolkit that makes stablecoin payments work smoothly in real shops and stadiums. It gives developers and POS providers a simple way to accept EURe and USDC, settle to merchants, and build extras like loyalty or refunds—using Ethereum with fast, low-cost transactions on Polygon.

## What’s inside

**Wallet SDK (non-custodial):** Native EURe & USDC support, NFC-based payments, and simple helpers that hide smart-contract complexity.

**ETHOS API:** A single, stable API that connects wallets, POS apps, and backends to on-chain settlement. Built for speed and easy integration on Polygon.

**Smart contracts:** Audited, modular contracts for merchant accounts, programmable settlement, fees/discounts, and future extensions.
